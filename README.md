# JIRAS-Movie-Recommender

This repo contains the files associated with the JIRAS Movie Recommender System project.

The project consisted of designing a relation database to store and search more than 200k movie records and designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram to map out inter-table relationships during database design phase.

Utilized Java Swing to visualize data trends related to content analytics requirements (such as most watched title, trending director/actor, least watched genre) and provided user recommendations using nested queries in PostgreSQL.


All technical documentation related to the database design can also be found here.
