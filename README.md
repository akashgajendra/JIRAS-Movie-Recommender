# JIRAS-Movie-Recommender

This repo contains the files associated with the JIRAS Movie Recommender System project. Development occured using the Waterfall methodology.

The project consisted of designing a relation database to store and search more than 200k movie records and designed an Entity-Relationship Diagram to map out inter-table relationships during database design phase. 

Conducted data cleaning using Python to eliminate duplicates, unwarranted data and null values. Utilized Java Swing to visualize data trends related to content analytics requirements (such as most watched title, trending director/actor, least watched genre) and provided user recommendations using nested queries in PostgreSQL.

Here's the ER diagram mapping relationships within the dataset
